#### Cleaning data ####
?airquality
head(airquality)
airquality$Ozone

which_rows_complete <- complete.cases(airquality)
airquality[which_rows_complete, ]

ozone_without_missing <- na.omit(airquality)


#### FILTERING data ####
# Subsetting by logical vectors comes in handy here
# Knockdown of which genes results in migration > 1?

which_rows_mig1 <- migmorph$migration > 1
migmorph[which_rows_mig1, ]
migmorph[!which_rows_mig1, ]
# Knockdown of which genes results in elongatedness < 1.5?

which_rows_elongatedness1.5 <- migmorph$elongatedness < 1.5
migmorph[which_rows_elongatedness1.5, ]

#### DETOUR: logical operations - AND OR ####

TRUE & TRUE     # AND
TRUE & FALSE
TRUE | TRUE     # OR
TRUE | FALSE
!TRUE # Negation
!FALSE # Negation

x = 5
x > 4 & x < 6
x > 4 | x > 6

# Filtering with more than one criterion
migmorph[which_rows_mig1 | which_rows_elongatedness1.5, ]

#### Problem set ####
# Use the migmorph data.frame for these questions

#Q1: Knockdown of which gene results in the highest migration?
# # hint: this can be accomplished with the max() function
#Q2: Rename the columns of the migmorph dataframe by adding the suffix "_new" to all of them
#Q3: Find out the migration and elongatedness values for the JUN gene.
#Q4: Is the migration value for the TNFRSF1B gene less than the migration value for the RET gene?
#Q5: Find out the mean of the elongatedness column; create a new column called "elongatedness_centred" in migmorph by dividing the elongatedness values by the mean elongatedness
#Q6: Make a new data.frame that has only rows with 0.9 > migration > 0.4 AND elongatedness > 1.4
#Q6.1: What is the correlation between migration and elongatedness in this new dataset?
#Q6.2: Draw an XY plot showing the relationship between these two variables in this new dataset
#Q7: Write the data.frame from Q6 to a new file named filtered_data.csv
